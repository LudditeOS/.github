# Tools, Not Distractions: Reclaim Your Digital Focus

LudditeOS is an open-source project aimed at creating a smartphone operating system that respects your attention and mental wellbeing. Based on LineageOS, our mission is to transform smartphones back into purposeful tools rather than endless sources of entertainment and distraction.

### Our Approach

- **Removing Attention Hijackers**: We've stripped out the default browser and app stores to prevent mindless browsing and social media use
- **Intentional Web Access**: Our custom Launcher provides access to essential web apps (transportation, language translation, etc.) without the temptation of endless scrolling
- **Minimal Digital Environment**: Focus on utility applications like messaging, email, and productivity tools

### Ideal Use Cases

Depending on your needs and digital wellness goals, LudditeOS can serve different purposes:

- First Phone for Children: Provide your child with essential communication tools (text, calls, WhatsApp) while protecting them from digital distractions and online risks
- Digital Detox Companion: Use as a secondary device during work hours, vacations, or whenever you need focused time without sacrificing essential connectivity
- Mindful Primary Device: Replace your current smartphone with a more intentional alternative that respects your attention and time

### Essential Tools & Applications

LudditeOS focuses on providing access to essential services without the downsides of a fully open ecosystem:

- Communication: WhatsApp, SMS, Phone calls
- Navigation & Transport: Maps, public transport timetables, ride-sharing services
- Productivity: Proton Mail, Proton Drive, Proton Calendar
- Utilities: Camera, calculator, notes

_We welcome community suggestions for additional essential tools that align with our philosophy_

### Current Status

LudditeOS is currently in early development and being actively tested daily. We're continuously refining the experience based on real-world usage.

Current supported devices:

- Google Pixel 6
- (we are working on adding more of the LineageOS supported devices)

### Technical Implementation

- **Base**: Custom build of LineageOS for Pixel 6
- **Core Components**:
  - Custom Launcher app for a distraction-free home screen
  - LudditeInstaller for controlled app installation
  - Integration with privacy-focused services (Proton Mail, Drive, etc.)
  - Capacitor-based web views

### Join Our Mission

If you believe smartphones should enhance your life without commanding your attention, we welcome your contributions. Whether you're a developer, designer, or simply interested in using a more mindful mobile OS, connect with us.
