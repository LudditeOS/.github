## Tools, Not Distractions: Reclaim Your Digital Focus

LudditeOS is an open-source project aimed at creating a smartphone operating system that respects your attention and mental wellbeing. Based on LineageOS, our mission is to transform smartphones back into purposeful tools rather than endless sources of entertainment and distraction.

### Our Approach

- **Removing Attention Hijackers**: We've stripped out the default browser and app stores to prevent mindless browsing and social media use
- **Intentional Web Access**: Our custom Launcher provides access to essential web apps (transportation, language translation, etc.) without the temptation of endless scrolling
- **Minimal Digital Environment**: Focus on utility applications like messaging, email, and productivity tools

### Current Status

LudditeOS is currently in early development and being actively tested daily. We're continuously refining the experience based on real-world usage.

Current supported devices:

- Google Pixel 6
- (we are working on adding more of the LineageOS supported devices)

### Technical Implementation

- **Base**: Custom build of LineageOS for Pixel 6
- **Core Components**:
  - Custom Launcher app for a distraction-free home screen
  - LudditeInstaller for controlled app installation
  - Integration with privacy-focused services (Proton Mail, Drive, etc.)
  - Capacitor-based web views
